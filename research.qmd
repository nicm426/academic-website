## Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of agricultural economics, quantitative methods, and policy analysis. I am particularly interested in:

- **Commodity Markets**: Price discovery, market integration, and volatility spillovers in agricultural futures markets
- **Agrifood Value Chains**: Developing quantitative tools and strategies for risk management along agricultural value chains
- **Forecasting Methods**: Developing and applying advanced time-series econometric models and machine learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy
- **Macroeconomic Transmission**: Understanding how macroeconomic shocks propagate through food systems and affect agricultural markets
