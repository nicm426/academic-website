### Food Price Inflation Forecasting: Insights from a Macroeconomic Auto-Regressive Random Forest Approach

**With Olga Isengildina Massa and Shamar Stewart**

*Abstract:* This study proposes a Macroeconomic Auto-Regressive Random Forest (MARRF) approach for forecasting annual U.S. food price inflation and evaluates its performance relative to the USDA's current SARIMA-based methodology. Leveraging the flexibility of ensemble machine learning and the interpretability of Generalized Time-Varying Parameters (GTVPs), the MARRF model integrates high-dimensional macroeconomic information extracted from the FRED-MD database to produce forecasts that are both accurate and economically informative. Through a fixed-event forecasting exercise spanning 2003â€“2022, we find that the MARRF model outperforms the SARIMA benchmark in terms of mean absolute percent errors (MAPE) and forecast bias, particularly at medium and long horizons and during periods of economic crisis. Variable importance metrics and time-varying parameters reveal shifting macroeconomic drivers of food inflation across time and forecast horizons, offering novel insights into the transmission of macroeconomic shocks to food prices.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of agricultural economics, quantitative methods, and policy analysis. I am particularly interested in:

-   **Commodity Markets**: Price discovery, market integration, and volatility spillovers in agricultural futures markets
-   **Agrifood Value Chains**: Developing quantitative tools and strategies for risk management along agricultural value chains
-   **Forecasting Methods**: Developing and applying advanced time-series econometric models and machine learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy
-   **Macroeconomic Transmission**: Understanding how macroeconomic shocks propagate through food systems and affect agricultural markets

## Research in Progress

### Agricultural Sector Financial Stress Index

*Early stage development*

Developing comprehensive measures of financial stress specific to the agricultural sector, incorporating both traditional financial indicators and novel machine learning approaches to provide early warning signals for policy intervention.
