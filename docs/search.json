This work aims to improve upon traditional forecasting models by capturing complex, nonlinear relationships while maintaining economic interpretability. I‚Äôm particularly interested in how macroeconomic shocks transmit through food systems and how advanced statistical methods can better predict these dynamics during periods of economic volatility."
